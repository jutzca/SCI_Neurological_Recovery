**Short summary:** Traumatic spinal cord injury constitutes a major public health issue, burdening both patients, caregivers, as well as society on a whole. The aim of this study was to analyze two decades of temporal trends in epidemiological and demographic characteristics, as well as neurological and functional recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury. In this longitudinal and observational study, we analyzed data from 4601 individuals with traumatic and ischemic spinal cord injury enrolled in the European Multi-Center Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI). Mixed-effect models were employed to account for the longitudinal nature of the data, efficiently handle missing data, and adjust for covariates, including age, sex, and injury characteristics. The primary outcomes comprised common scores to quantify neurological (i.e., motor and sensory scores examined according to the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury [ISNCSCI]) and functional recovery (e.g., Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), walking function) as well as demographics and injury characteristics. We externally validated our findings using data (n=791) from a completed landmark clinical trial.Over the course of almost 20 years, the ratio of male:female patients remained stable at 4:1. The distribution of age at injury changed significantly, with a shift from unimodal (2001) to bimodal distribution (2019). In terms of injury characteristics, the proportional distribution of injury severities and levels remained stable with the largest percentages of sensorimotor complete (i.e., AIS-A) and incomplete injuries (i.e., AIS-D). The rate and pattern of neurological and functional recovery remained unchanged throughout the surveillance period with the exception of age at injury. The findings were confirmed by an external North American validation study. Despite considerable advances in the acute care and rehabilitation of acute spinal cord injury the data suggest that neurological and functional recovery have remained largely stable over the last at least 2 decades. The robust and comparable finding of European and North American clinical data enables some international benchmarking of SCI recovery. The accumulated comprehensive and validated recovery profiles within the EMSCI network may serve as a valuable resource to inform clinical practice as well as guide the design and implementation of forthcoming clinical trials. As such, we have provided an interactive, open-access app that could be used in further exploring our data or as a clinical surveillance tool.
