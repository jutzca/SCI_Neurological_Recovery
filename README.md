**Short summary:** Our study addresses two aims: Firstly, we will investigate the changes in profile of traumatic spinal cord injury over the last 20 years. A major focus will be put on the change in age distribution as well as the injury severity and level as well as geographical differences. Secondly, we will address the question to what extend the amount of recovery (stratified by injury characteristics) has changed over the last two decades. Based on previous evidence, we hypothesize that the profile of traumatic spinal cord injury has drastically changed over the last 20 years in terms of age at injury and the injury severity. The second hypothesis is that the amount of recovery after a spinal cord injury (after adjusting for injury severity and level) has not markedly changed over the last two decades.
